# The Pen is Mighter Than the Sword
A wiki edited by members of Timcast.

I do not know how to make a wiki, and I do not feel like paying for a domain. 
So, here we are, using GitHub.

# How to submit articles

> As I do not know the structure of this project just yet, I cannot
> give exact instructions. But this seems to be the basic outline for now.

1. Edit/create a file
2. Create a pull request
3. Put your Discord tag [eg `PRIZ ;]#9244`] in the title of the pull request
4. Submit

If you are approved, you will be notified of the successful merge.

Please only edit one file per request, as editing multiple files may
have conflicting changes with other requests.
